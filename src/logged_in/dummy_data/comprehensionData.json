  "comprehensionText": "The story of the Ancient Greeks spans thousands of years and is full of exciting events, influential people, and great accomplishments. Let's begin our journey around 3000 BC, with the Bronze Age. This was the time when people started to use metals to make tools and weapons. On a small island named Crete, there was a group of people called the Minoans. They built grand palaces, loved sports and games, and were good sailors. But around 1450 BC, the Minoan civilization mysteriously ended. After the Minoans, the Mycenaeans came to power on the mainland of Greece. They built strong fortresses on top of hills and were great warriors. You might have heard of the legendary Trojan War â€“ that's right, it was during the Mycenaean times! However, around 1100 BC, the Mycenaean civilization also collapsed. After the Mycenaeans, Greece entered the Dark Ages, where writing was forgotten, and people lived in small, isolated villages. But don't worry, this period didn't last forever. In 800 BC, things started to get better. This period is called the Archaic Period. The Greeks began to build city-states, each with its own government and way of life. Two of the most famous city-states were Athens, known for its democracy and love of wisdom, and Sparta, known for its strong army. The Greeks also started to compete in sports competitions which we now know as the Olympic Games! Next came the Classical Period, around 500 BC, which was a golden age for Greece. In Athens, great philosophers like Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle questioned the world around them and shared their ideas. The Athenians also built beautiful temples, like the Parthenon, to honor their gods and goddesses. During this time, the Greeks had to fight off invaders, like the powerful Persian Empire. But they managed to protect their lands in epic battles like Marathon and Thermopylae. Sadly, the Greek city-states were often at war with each other too. The most famous of these was the Peloponnesian War between Athens and Sparta. In the end, Sparta won, but the wars weakened all of Greece. By 338 BC, a strong leader named Philip II from Macedonia, a region in Northern Greece, was able to take control of the city-states. When Philip died, his son, Alexander the Great, became king. He was an extraordinary leader and soldier. Alexander created a massive empire that stretched all the way from Greece to Egypt and India. When Alexander died in 323 BC, his vast empire broke into smaller kingdoms, and this period is known as the Hellenistic Period. It was a time of great learning, and Greek culture spread far and wide. Around 146 BC, Greece became part of the Roman Empire. Though this marked the end of the Ancient Greeks, their stories, ideas, and achievements lived on. Even today, we still learn from their wisdom, enjoy their myths, and marvel at their inventions. Indeed, the Ancient Greeks had a big part in shaping the world as we know it today.",
